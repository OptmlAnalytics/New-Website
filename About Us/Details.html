                <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
              <h3>
                This privacy policy (the Privacy Policy) describes the types of information OptmlAnalytics Inc. (OptmlAnalytics or we) collects from you, or from subscribers (you or your) to OptmlAnalytics’s software applications and platforms, including the enhancements, features, related website, and contents (the Services). It also describes how we use and disclose such information, as well as your rights with respect to OptmlAnalytics’s collection, use, and disclosure of such information. We understand the importance of your privacy and we treat all information we receive in a responsible manner. By downloading or accessing the Services, you agree that we may collect, use, and disclose Personal Data, Aggregate Information, and Cookies pursuant to this Privacy Policy. We may change or update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the revised version on the Services, such as on OptmlAnalytics’s website. So, you should periodically verify the date of this Privacy Policy to ensure that you are familiar with the most up-to-date version, as the most up-to-date version will govern your use of the Services.
              </h3>
              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <h3>When you use the Services, OptmlAnalytics may collect three types of information:
<br></br>
(1) Peronsal Data
Personal Data is any information directly or indirectly relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.
<br></br>
(2) Aggregate Data
Aggregate Information is information about your activities on or in connection with the Services that typically cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you. For example, Aggregate Information includes information regarding the frequency of use of the Services, quantity and type of data entered when using the Services, components of the Services most frequently accessed, and browser types used to access the Services.
<br></br>
(3) Cookies, etc.
Cookies, beacons, device identifiers, or similar technologies (referred to for convenience as Cookies) are small pieces of data placed on your device that your web browser or device uses to access the Services and that permit OptmlAnalytics to track your activity on the Services. We obtain information from Cookies when, for example, you visit OptmlAnalytics’s website. You may turn off cookies in your browser or device settings, but this may limit functionality of the Services. Cookies help analyze usage and provide certain functionality. Cookies don’t contain Personal Data and for that reason, we treat Cookies in the same manner as we treat Aggregate Information. If Cookies do contain Personal Data, such Personal Data will only be used or disclosed in the same manner as other Personal Data pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Cookies cannot be used as a malicious tool.
</h3>

</h3>
<h2>Using and Sharing Personal Data<h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics uses Personal Data we collect:<br></br>

to provide the Services;<br></br>
to improve the features and functionality of the Services;<br></br>
to communicate with you in response to any of your questions and requests; or<br></br>
to provide relevant marketing and other information to you, but only if, and to the extent that, you have consented to us providing such marketing and other information to you in accordance with applicable laws. In such a case, we will provide an easy link to permit you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications.<br></br>
In rare cases, OptmlAnalytics may be required, or may, acting in good faith, believe it is required, to share certain information with legal authorities. In such a case, OptmlAnalytics will provide only the minimum amount of information required and, unless prohibited by law, OptmlAnalytics will notify you of the Personal Data it has provided. Such cases include:<br></br>

if required by law;<br></br>
to protect or defend against legal liability;<br></br>
to protect persons from immediate danger, such as personal injury or death; or<br></br>
to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft.<br></br>
OptmlAnalytics may share Personal Data with third party service providers as OptmlAnalytics deems necessary for such third-party service providers to perform their duties required for the Services to function. For example, the Services may utilize mail relays, payment processers, and hosting providers. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use Personal Data for any purposes other than to provide the services for which they have been retained to provide in accordance with their respective terms and conditions.<br></br>

You may have the option to enable a third-party integration or an API with respect to the Services, if you choose to do so, then you may be sharing your Personal Data and Aggregate Information with that third-party.<br></br>

OptmlAnalytics does not sell or otherwise share Personal Data with unrelated third parties.<br></br>

Personal Data may be transferred to OptmlAnalytics’s affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, or as part of a sale of substantially all of the assets of OptmlAnalytics. In such a case, each such party will be required to hold Personal Data and not disclose Personal Data except in accordance with terms at least as restrictive as those contained in this Privacy Policy.<br></br>
</h3>
<h2>Using and Sharing Aggregate Information</h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics uses Aggregate Information:<br></br>

to provide the Services;<br></br>
to improve the Services;<br></br>
to monitor usage of the Services;<br></br>
to analyze usage of the Services;<br></br>
to research, compile, and report on usage trends, user demographics, and user behaviors;<br></br>
or for other legitimate business-related purposes.<br></br>
OptmlAnalytics may share Aggregate Information with its affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, and certain third parties, such as investors, potential investors, and third-party service providers we use to provide the Services.<br></br>

Aggregate Information is anonymized and does not have the capacity to be used to identify an individual. In other words, OptmlAnalytics may share this information but no Personal Data will be disclosed to third parties.
</h3>
<h2>Location Information</h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics may use the Services to collect and use location information to provide certain functionality. All such information will be governed by this Privacy Policy as Personal Data or Aggregate Data as the case may be.</h3>

</h3>
<h2>Security and Data Protection</h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics takes appropriate security measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction.
<br></br>

<br></br>
OptmlAnalytics restricts access to Personal Data to its personnel, service providers and agents who need to know such information in order to operate, develop or improve the Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and are required to treat such Personal Data confidentially and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</h3>
<h2>Data Processing and GDPR</h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics is a data processor and not the data controller for Your Personal Data. This means that OptmlAnalytics performs operations on Personal Data, but it does not control your Personal Data. With respect to your Personal Data, the person inputting such Personal Data is the controller.
<br></br>
OptmlAnalytics processes Personal Data only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. OptmlAnalytics takes reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data we process is accurate, complete, and current.
<br></br>
Individuals located in or originating from certain regions, such as the European Economic Area, have certain rights in relation to their Personal Data, as outlined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as amended (General Data Protection Regulation, commonly referred to as GDPR). To the extent OptmlAnalytics has access to, or processes Personal Data for individuals who are subject to GDPR, that is, Personal Data originating from the European Union, OptmlAnalytics will adhere to the requirements of GDPR.
<br></br>
OptmlAnalytics may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live.
<br></br>
You may have the right to access your Personal Data and require OptmlAnalytics to update, delete or correct this information. The Services permit you to update this information directly. In the alternative, you may e-mail OptmlAnalytics for further access and assistance. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Data in OptmlAnalytics’s possession.
</h3>
<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<h3>OptmlAnalytics’s third-party payment processors may require certain financial information, such as credit card information. We will not have access to this information. At all times, OptmlAnalytics will comply in all respects with applicable consumer protection laws.
</h3>
<h2>Corrections and Removals</h2>
<h3>If any part of your Personal Data, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number or other personal information changes, you may update, correct or remove the relevant information by contacting OptmlAnalytics.
